## Layout tips

We can use grid system with column spans to make it responsive
We can conditionally hide or show stuff if its a larger screen or no


## Neon
It provides the postgre db required to store info about the users

## Prisma 
Its a framework or middleman between code and db where we dont have to write complex queries instead prisma will do it for us
